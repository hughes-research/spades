# deck-algorithms

Card management systems implemented in `src/lib/game/deck.ts` provide Spades-specific deck manipulation and analysis:

## Core Functionality

1. Hand Sorting Logic
- Custom sorting prioritizing spades (trump) suits
- Secondary sorting by card rank within suits
- Special handling for nil bid hand arrangements
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Suit Distribution Analysis
- Tracks distribution of suits across dealt hands
- Calculates void suit probabilities
- Monitors spade count per player
Importance Score: 80/100

3. Hand Strength Evaluation
- Evaluates overall hand strength for bidding
- Considers high card concentration
- Weights spades more heavily than other suits
Importance Score: 85/100

4. Specialized Card Management
- Optimized sorting for Spades gameplay
- Hand analysis for strategic play decisions
- Suit distribution tracking
Importance Score: 75/100

## Integration Points

Hand evaluation system connects directly with:
- AI bidding strategy components
- Valid play determination
- Partnership coordination logic

Key relationships:
- Provides hand analysis data to AI strategy module
- Supports rules engine with suit following validation
- Enables accurate probability calculations for trick-taking
