description: Core algorithms and logic for managing card decks, sorting, and hand analysis in a Spades game context
---


# deck-algorithms

Located in `src/lib/game/deck.ts`, the deck management system implements specialized card handling logic specific to Spades gameplay:

## Core Components

### Hand Analysis Functions
- Detailed suit distribution tracking
- Card strength evaluation for AI bidding decisions
- Specialized sorting and organization of cards within hands

### Card Sorting Logic
Implements custom sorting algorithms that:
- Group cards by suit
- Order cards by rank within suits
- Prioritize spades due to trump status

### Distribution Analysis
Performs statistical analysis of:
- Suit distribution across hands
- High card concentration
- Trump card (spades) distribution

## Integration Points

Deck algorithms provide essential data to other game components:
- Feeds hand strength data to AI bidding system
- Supports valid play validation
- Assists in trick-winning calculations
- Enables spades breaking rule enforcement

Importance Score: 75/100
